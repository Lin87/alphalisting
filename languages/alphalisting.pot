#. translators: List the aphabet of your language in the order that your
#. language prefers. list as groups of identical meanings but different
#. characters together, e.g. in English we group A with a because they are both
#. the same letter but different character-code. Each character group should be
#. followed by a comma separating it from the next group. Any amount of
#. characters per group are acceptible, and there is no requirement for all the
#. groups to contain the same amount of characters as all the others. Be
#. careful with the character you place first in each group as that will be
#. used as the identifier for the group which gets displayed on the page, e.g.
#. in English a group definition of "Aa" will indicate that we display all the
#. posts in the group, i.e. whose titles begin with either "A" or "a", listed
#. under a heading of "A" (the first character in the definition).
